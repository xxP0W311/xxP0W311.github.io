<h2><div class="ex1">Disc Jockey</div></h2>

<ul><h3>
  <li>Around two years ago I started to be really interested in dance and techno music, I followed all the major DJ's and started 
  to DJ myself. I have worked with music and learned how to connect songs and how to make the crowd happy, following my idols it 
  helps me learn and grow to be better. I have hosted a few events where I was a DJ and it was some of the best moments in my life,
  it is something I enjoy more than anything.</li>
</h3></ul>

<h2><div class="ex1">Producing</div></h2>

<ul><h3>
  <li>When I started to DJ I also started to make my own music, I have no released any songs of my own but I enjoy to make them for 
  myself so I can learn and get better. In the future I will release songs and work on being a better producer and do something I love.
  I use a software called Ableton Live, in Ableton you can use a keyboard or any kind of sound or midi controller. You can use 
  these tools to make rhythms and others audio effects to make your song flow together and sound like anything you want. <p>Click 
  <a href="https://www.ableton.com">here</a> and it bring you to the Ableton Live homepage.</p></li>
