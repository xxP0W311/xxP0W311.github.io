<h1>Travel/Photography</h1>

<h2><div class="ex1">Where Have I traveled?</div></h2>

<ul><h3>
<li>I have been to many countries in my life and I hope to visit every continent when I get older. I have been to Denmark, Iceland, 
many places in the Florida & Mexico, and many other places down in the Caribbean. Traveling is one of my favorite things because  
you get to see other cultures that are so unique and special. I love the plane rides because it feels like a ride at an amusement 
park, it is one of my favorite parts about
traveling.</li>
</h3></ul>

<h2><div class="ex1">Faroe Islands & Iceland</div></h2>

<h3><ul>
  <li>My mother is from a small island called the Faroe Islands which is located bellow Iceland and is part of the Danish Kingdom.
  We visit here every other summer to say hi to family and relatives that we rarely see and to enjoy some of the activities. On our
  way to the Faroe Islands we take a connecting flight from Iceland to the Faroe Islands where we stop and take a nice break at the
  Blue Lagoon. The Blue Lagoon is a natural hot spring that has subsided and is now a tourist attraction. This is one of my favorite
  parts of our trip because it is truly unique and it is very enjoyable.</li>
</ul></h3>

<h2><div class="ex1">Photography</div></h2>

<h3><ul>
  <li>Along with traveling, I really enjoy taking photos with my DSLR. I have a Nikon D7000 camera that I got around 3 years ago that I use constantly. I love taking night photos and long exposures, these are my favorite because you can do so much with them and have some really cool and wild effects. </li>
  <p>Here are some photos that I have taken over the past few years.</p>
