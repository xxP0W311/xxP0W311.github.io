  graduated and went to Holten Richmond Middle School. There I only stayed until 7th grade when my family moved a town over to 
  Middleton MA. I transfered to Masconomet in 8th grade for one year where I then moved on to highschool.</li>

<h2><div class="ex1">Social Media</div></h2>

<ul><h3>
  <li>I have been using social media for so long I can't even remember when I started to use it. I am not very active with my social
  media but now that I am in college I realize how important it is. LinkedIn is a new social media I am using and I intend to use
  it more now that I know the importance of it.</li>
